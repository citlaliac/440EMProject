      "1. Accounting Policies\n",
      "\n",
      "Principles of Consolidation--The consolidated financial statements include the\n",
      "accounts of all significant subsidiaries. Investments in other companies which\n",
      "are at least 20% owned are reported on the equity method. All significant\n",
      "intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Property, Plant and Equipment - Depreciation--Depreciation is computed on the\n",
      "straight-line method for financial accounting purposes and on accelerated\n",
      "methods for tax purposes. Estimated useful lives for major asset categories are\n",
      "10-55 years for buildings and improvements, 4-20 years for broadcasting\n",
      "equipment and 5-20 years for publishing machinery and equipment. Leasehold\n",
      "improvements are amortized over the terms of the leases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intangible Assets--Intangible assets consist of amounts by which the cost of\n",
      "acquisitions exceeded the values assigned to net tangible assets. The\n",
      "broadcasting and publishing intangible assets, all of which may be characterized\n",
      "as scarce assets with very long and productive lives, have historically\n",
      "increased in value with the passage of time. In accordance with Accounting\n",
      "Principles Board Opinion No. 17, substantially all of these intangible assets\n",
      "are being amortized over periods of up to 40 years, even though in the opinion\n",
      "of management there has been no diminution of value of the underlying assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Program Licenses and Rights--Program licenses and rights and related \n",
      "liabilities are recorded when the license period begins and the program is\n",
      "available for use.  Television network and station rights for theatrical movies\n",
      "and other long-form programming are charged to expense primarily on accelerated \n",
      "bases related to the usage of the program.  Television network series costs and \n",
      "multi-year sports rights are charged to expense based on the flow of \n",
      "anticipated revenue.         \n",
      "\n",
      "Short-Term Investments--Short-term investments consist of highly liquid U.S.\n",
      "Government instruments with original maturities in excess of three months and\n",

BUSINESS\\n\\n  URS Corporation (the \"Company\") offers a broad range of planning, design\\nand program and construction management services for engineering,\\narchitectural and environmental projects.  The Company serves public and\\nprivate sector clients throughout the United States in two principal markets:\\ninfrastructure projects involving transportation systems, institutional and\\ncommercial facilities and water resources; and environmental projects\\ninvolving hazardous waste management and pollution control.\\n\\n  The Company conducts its business through 24 offices located throughout the\\nUnited States.  The Company has approximately 1,100 full-time employees, many\\nof whom hold advanced or technical degrees and have extensive experience in\\nsophisticated disciplines applicable to the Company\\'s business.  The Company\\nbelieves that its geographic and technical diversity allow it to compete for\\nlocal, regional and national projects, and enable it to apply to each project\\na variety of resources from its national network.\\n\\n                                  Services\\n                                  --------\\n\\n  The Company provides professional services in three major areas:  planning,\\ndesign and program and construction management through the Company\\'s\\n24 offices.  Each of these offices is responsible for obtaining local or\\nregional contracts.  This approach allows regional government agencies and\\nprivate clients to view the Company\\'s offices as local businesses with\\nsuperior service delivery capabilities.  Because the Company can draw from\\nits large and diverse network of professional and technical resources, the\\nCompany has the capability to market and perform large, multi-state projects.\\n\\nPlanning\\n- --------\\n\\n  Planning covers a broad range of assignments, ranging from conceptual\\ndesign and technical and economic feasibility studies to community\\ninvolvement programs.  Planning services also involve developing alternative\\nconcepts for project implementation and analyzing the impacts of each\\nalternative.\\n\\n  In addition to traditional engineering and architectural planning services,\\nthe Company has extensive expertise in a number of highly specialized areas,\\nincluding toll facilities, health care facility renovation, environmental\\nsite analysis, water quality planning for urban storm water management and\\nsite remediation assignments.\\n\\n\\n                              Page 2 of 90                             \\n\\nDesign\\n- ------\\n\\n  The Company\\'s professionals provide a broad range of design and\\ndesign-related services, including computerized mapping, architectural and\\ninterior design, civil, sanitary and geotechnical engineering, process design\\nand seismic (earthquake) analysis and design.  For each project, the Company\\nidentifies the project requirements and then integrates and coordinates the\\nvarious design elements.  The result is a set of contract documents that may\\ninclude plans, specifications and cost estimates that are used to build a\\nproject.  These documents detail design characteristics and set forth for the\\ncontractor the materials which should be used and the schedule for\\nconstruction.  Other critical tasks in the design process may include value\\nanalysis and the assessment of construction and maintenance requirements.\\n\\nProgram and Construction Management\\n- -----------------------------------\\n\\n  The Company\\'s program and construction management services include master\\nscheduling of both the design and construction phases, construction and\\nlife-cycle cost estimating, cash flow analysis, value engineering,\\nconstructability reviews and bid management.  Once construction has begun,\\nthe Company supervises and coordinates the activities of the construction\\ncontractor.  This frequently involves acting as the owner\\'s representative\\nfor on-site supervision and inspection of the contractor\\'s work.  In this\\nrole, the Company\\'s objective is to monitor a project\\'s schedule, cost and\\nquality.  The Company generally does not take contractual responsibility for\\nthe contractor\\'s risks and methods, nor for site safety conditions.\\n\\n                                   Markets\\n                                   -------\\n  The Company\\'s strategy is to focus on two major markets:  infrastructure\\nprojects involving transportation systems, institutional and commercial\\nfacilities and water resources; and environmental projects involving\\nhazardous waste management and pollution control.  The Company has developed\\na nationwide identity based on its successful completion of a number of\\nhighly visible rehabilitation and expansion projects in these markets. \\nAlthough the Company views these markets as being distinct, the Company\\nprovides its planning, design and program and construction management\\nservices to both markets.\\n\\nInfrastructure\\n- --------------\\n\\n  The Company has significant expertise in three areas relating to the\\ninfrastructure market: transportation systems, institutional and commercial\\nfacilities and water resources projects.\\n\\n                              Page 3 of 90                             \\n\\n  TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS.  The Company\\'s engineers, designers, planners and\\nmanagers provide services for projects involving all types of transportation\\nnetworks, such as highways, roadways, streets, bridges, rapid and mass\\ntransit systems, airports and marine facilities.  These services range from\\nthe design of interstate highways to harbor traffic simulation studies and\\nmay extend from conceptual planning through preliminary and final design to\\nconstruction management.  Historically, the Company\\'s emphasis in this area\\nhas been on the design of new transportation facilities, but in recent years\\nthe rehabilitation of existing facilities has become a major focus.\\n \\n  INSTITUTIONAL AND COMMERCIAL FACILITIES.  The Company provides\\narchitectural, engineering design, space planning and construction\\nsupervision services to this market.  Demand for low-maintenance, energy\\nefficient facilities drive today\\'s market for commercial and industrial\\nbuildings.  In addition, there is increased pressure to renovate facilities\\nto meet changing needs and current building standards.\\n\\n  WATER RESOURCES.  The Company\\'s capabilities in this market include the\\nplanning, design and program and construction management of water supply,\\nstorage, distribution and treatment systems, as well as work in basin plans,\\ngroundwater supply, customer rate studies, urban run-off, bond issues, flood\\ncontrol, water quality analysis and beach erosion control.\\n\\nEnvironmental\\n- -------------\\n  The Company has developed expertise in two principal environmental markets: \\nhazardous waste management and pollution control.\\n\\n  HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT.  The Company conducts initial site\\ninvestigations, designs remedial actions for site clean-up and provides\\nconstruction management services during site clean-up.  This market involves\\nidentifying and developing measures to effectively dispose of hazardous and\\ntoxic waste at contaminated sites.  The Company also provides air quality\\nmonitoring and designs individual facility modifications required to meet\\nlocal, state and Federal air quality standards.  This work requires\\nspecialized knowledge of and compliance with complex Federal and state\\nregulations, as well as the permitting and approval processes.  Solid waste\\nmanagement services provided by the Company include facility siting, transfer\\nstation design and community-wide master planning.\\n\\n  The Company has been awarded several significant contracts with government\\nagencies, including a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense for\\nenvironmental engineering and remediation work in the Northwest and Alaska\\nunder the Comprehensive Long-Term Environmental Action-Navy (\"Navy CLEAN\")\\nprogram and two contracts with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\\n(\"EPA\") under its Alternative Remedial Contracting Strategy (\"EPA ARCS\")\\nprogram.  Under the Navy CLEAN contract, the Company provides site\\ninspections, site characterizations, remediation designs and action plans for\\ncontaminated Navy facilities.  A portion of the Navy CLEAN contract, which is\\nexpected to have a ten-year term, is awarded each year over the life of the\\ncontract.  In fiscal 1993 and 1992, the Company generated revenues associated\\nwith the Navy CLEAN contract of $22.1 million and $29.3 million,\\nrespectively.  The Company\\'s services under the ten year EPA ARCS contracts\\ninclude investigating the nature and extent of contamination by hazardous\\nmaterials, performing risk assessments, evaluating the feasibility of various\\noptions for remedial action and providing management, technical, quality\\nassurance and health and safety reviews of potentially responsible party\\nsubmittals.  Work under the EPA ARCS contracts is performed on a task order\\n\\n                              Page 4 of 90                             \\n\\nbasis.  In fiscal 1993 and 1992, the Company recognized revenues of $16.5\\nmillion and $12.4 million, respectively, under the EPA ARCS contracts.\\n\\n  POLLUTION CONTROL.  The Company\\'s principal services in this market include\\nthe planning and design of new wastewater facilities, such as sewer systems\\nand wastewater treatment plants, and the analysis and expansion of existing\\nsystems.  The types of work performed by the Company include infiltration/\\ninflow studies, combined sewer overflow studies, water quality facilities\\nplanning projects and design and construction management services for\\nwastewater treatment plants.\\n\\n                                   Clients\\n                                   -------\\nGeneral\\n- -------\\n  The Company\\'s clients include local, state and Federal government agencies\\nand private sector businesses.  Since 1989, revenues from Federal government\\nprojects have increased as a percentage of the Company\\'s total revenues.  The\\nCompany\\'s revenues from local, state and Federal government agencies and\\nprivate businesses for the last five fiscal years are as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n              1993               1992                1991               1990              1989\\n              ----               ----                ----               ----              ----\\n                                               (In thousands)\\n          \\nLocal and\\n state \\nagencies    $ 80,350     55%   $ 65,315     48%   $ 68,720      56%   $ 62,056     59%    $58,640     64%\\n\\nFederal\\n agencies     48,713     33      52,530     38      35,614      29      28,398     27      16,460     18\\n\\nPrivate\\n Business     16,698     12      18,948     14      18,504      15      14,725     14      16,365     18\\n            --------    ----   --------    ----   --------     ----   --------    ----   --------    ----\\n\\n Total      $145,761    100%   $136,793    100%   $122,838     100%   $105,179    100%    $91,465    100%\\n             =======    ====    =======    ====    =======     ====    =======    ====    =======    ====\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              Page 5 of 90                             \\n\\n\\nContract Pricing and Terms of Engagement\\n- ----------------------------------------\\n  Under its cost-plus contracts, the Company charges clients negotiated rates\\nbased on the Company\\'s direct and indirect costs.  Labor costs and\\nsubcontractor services are the principal components of the Company\\'s direct\\ncosts.  Federal Acquisition Regulations limit the recovery of certain\\nspecified indirect costs on contracts subject to such regulations .  In\\nnegotiating a cost-plus contract, the Company estimates all recoverable\\ndirect and indirect costs and then adds a profit component, which is either a\\npercentage of total recoverable costs or a fixed negotiated fee, to arrive at\\na total dollar estimate for the project.  The Company receives payment based\\non the total actual number of labor hours expended.  If the actual total\\nnumber of labor hours is lower than estimated, the revenues from that project\\nwill be lower than estimated.  If the actual labor hours expended exceed the\\ninitial negotiated amount, the Company must obtain a contract modification in\\norder to receive payment for such overage.  The Company\\'s profit margin will\\nincrease to the extent the Company is able to reduce actual costs below the\\nestimates used to produce the negotiated fixed prices on contracts not\\ncovered by Federal Acquisition Regulations; conversely, the Company\\'s profit\\nmargin will decrease and the Company may realize a loss on the project if the\\nCompany does not control costs and exceeds the overall estimates used to\\nproduce the negotiated price.\\n\\n  Cost-plus contracts covered by Federal Acquisition Regulations require an\\naudit of actual costs and provide for upward or downward adjustments if\\nactual recoverable costs differ from billed recoverable costs.  The Defense\\nContract Audit Agency, auditors for the Department of Defense and other\\nFederal agencies, has completed incurred cost audits of the Company\\'s Federal\\ncontracts for fiscal years ended through October 31, 1986, resulting in\\nimmaterial adjustments.  The Company does not anticipate significant contract\\nadjustments or other government action resulting from government audits of\\nthe years 1987 through 1993.\\n\\n  Under its fixed-price contracts, the Company receives an agreed sum\\nnegotiated in advance for the specified scope of work.  Under fixed-price\\ncontracts, no payment adjustments are made if the Company over-estimates or\\nunder-estimates the number of labor hours required to complete the project,\\nunless there is a change of scope in the work to be performed.  Accordingly,\\nthe Company\\'s profit margin will increase to the extent the number of labor\\nhours and other costs are below the contracted amounts.  The profit margin\\nwill decrease and the Company may realize a loss on the project if the number\\nof labor hours required and other costs exceed the estimates.\\n\\nBacklog, Project Designations and Indefinite Delivery Contracts\\n- ---------------------------------------------------------------\\n  The Company\\'s contract backlog was $142.0 million at October 31, 1993,\\ncompared to $123.5 million at October 31, 1992.  The Company\\'s contract\\nbacklog consists of the amount billable at a particular point in time for\\nfuture services under executed, funded contracts.  Indefinite delivery\\ncontracts, which are executed contracts requiring the issuance of task\\norders, are included in contract backlog only to the extent the task orders\\nare actually issued and funded.  Of the contract backlog of $142.0 million at\\nOctober 31, 1993, approximately 30%, or $43 million, is not reasonably\\nexpected to be filled within the next fiscal year ending October 31, 1994.\\n\\n  The Company has also been designated by customers as the recipient of\\ncertain future contracts.  These \"designations\" are projects that have been\\nawarded to the Company but for which contracts have not yet been executed. \\n\\n                              Page 6 of 90                             \\n\\nTask orders under executed indefinite delivery contracts which are expected\\nto be issued in the immediate future are included in designations.  Total\\ncontract designations were estimated to be $213.6 million at October 31,\\n1993, as compared to $154.8 million at October 31, 1992.  Typically, a\\nsignificant portion of designations are converted into signed contracts. \\nHowever, there is no assurance this will continue to occur in the future.\\n\\n  Indefinite delivery contracts are signed contracts where work is performed\\nonly when specific task orders are issued by the client.  Generally these\\ncontracts exceed one year and often indicate a maximum term and potential\\nvalue.  Examples of such contracts are the Navy CLEAN and EPA ARCs contracts. \\nCertain indefinite delivery contracts are for a definite time period with\\nrenewal option periods at the client\\'s discretion.  While the Company\\nbelieves that it will continue to get work under these contracts over their\\nentire term, because of renewals and the necessity for issuance of individual\\ntask orders, continued work by the Company and the realization of their\\npotential maximum values under these contracts is not assured.\\n\\n  However, because of the increasing frequency with which the Company\\'s\\ngovernment and private sector clients use this contracting method, the\\nCompany believes their potential value should be disclosed along with backlog\\nand designations as an indicator of the Company\\'s future business.  When the\\nclient notifies the Company of the scope and pricing of task orders, the\\nestimated value of such task orders are added to designations.  When such\\ntask orders are signed and funded, their value goes into backlog.  At\\nOctober 31, 1993, the potential value of the Company\\'s five largest\\nindefinite delivery contracts was as follows:\\n\\n                                                                    At October 31, 1993\\n                                                                   -------------------------------------\\n                                    Total          Revenues                                     Estimated\\n                                  Potential     Recognized thru      Funded       Estimated     Remaining\\nContract            Term           Values       October 31, 1993     Backlog     Designations     Values \\n- --------            ----          ---------     ----------------     -------     ------------   ---------\\n                                                  (In millions)\\n      \\nEPAARCs (9&10)      1989-1999      $182.5           $ 15.6            $6.5          $ 5.2         $155.2 \\n\\nNavy CLEAN          1989-1999       166.0             78.6             7.9            4.9           74.6\\n\\nEPAARCs (6,7&8)     1989-1999       119.7             27.9             5.5           26.0           60.3\\n\\nPlattsburgh AFB     1992-1997       100.0              1.0             2.4            6.9           89.7\\n\\nNY State\\n Environmental \\n Remediation        1989-1996        20.0              6.4             1.5             -            12.1\\n                                    -----            -----            ----           ----          -----\\n    Total                          $588.2           $129.5           $23.8          $43.0         $391.9\\n                                    =====            =====            ====           ====          =====\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              Page 7 of 90                             \\n\\n                                 Competition\\n                                 -----------\\n\\n  The engineering and architectural services industry is highly fragmented\\nand very competitive.

MANAGEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL\\n         CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n\\n                            Results of Operations\\n\\nFiscal 1993 Compared with Fiscal 1992\\n- -------------------------------------\\n  Revenues in fiscal 1993 were $145.8 million, or 7% over the amount reported\\nin fiscal 1992.  The growth in revenues is primarily attributable to\\nincreases in revenues derived from all areas of the Company\\'s business,\\nparticularly transportation and other infrastructure projects in the\\nNortheast.  Revenues generated from the Company\\'s three largest contracts;\\nNavy CLEAN; EPA ARCS 9&10; and EPA ARCS 6, 7, & 8, decreased slightly in\\nfiscal 1993 to $38.5 million as compared to $41.7 million in fiscal 1992. \\nThe decrease in revenues from these contracts is primarily due to a decrease\\nin the number of task orders for hazardous waste services on the Navy CLEAN\\ncontract.  Revenues generated from private commercial businesses decreased\\nfrom $18.9 million in fiscal 1992 to $16.7 million in fiscal 1993.\\n\\n  Direct operating expenses, which consist of direct labor and direct\\nexpenses, including subcontractor costs, increased $6.1 million, or 7%, over\\nthe amount reported in fiscal 1992.  The increase is due to an overall\\nincrease in the Company\\'s business in fiscal 1993 as compared to fiscal 1992. \\nIndirect general and administrative expenses (\"IG&A\") increased to\\n$51.6 million in fiscal 1993 from $45.5 million in fiscal 1992.  Expressed as\\na percentage of revenues, IG&A expenses increased from 33% in fiscal 1992 to\\n35% in fiscal 1993.   The increase in IG&A expenses is primarily attributable\\nto the overall increase in the Company\\'s business and to the one-time charge\\nof $2.0 million taken in the third quarter of fiscal 1993 in connection with\\nthe planned phase-out of certain of the Company\\'s architectural offices and\\nfor claims on certain of the Company\\'s architectural projects.  To a lesser\\nextent, IG&A expenses increased due to program delays experienced in\\nconnection with certain of the Company\\'s contracts.  Net interest expense\\nremained relatively constant at $1.2 million in fiscal 1993.\\n\\n\\n                              Page 14 of 90                            \\n\\n  The Company earned $1.4 million before income taxes in fiscal 1993 compared\\nto $4.7 million in fiscal 1992.  While the Company has available net\\noperating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes, for state\\nincome tax purposes such amounts are not necessarily available to offset\\nincome subject to tax.  Accordingly, the Company\\'s effective tax rate for\\nfiscal 1993 was approximately 10%.\\n\\n  Net income decreased to $1.3 million in fiscal 1993 as compared to\\n$4.3 million in fiscal 1992.  The Company earned $.18 per share in fiscal\\n1993 compared to $.55 per share in fiscal 1992.\\n\\n  The Company\\'s backlog of signed and funded contracts at October 31, 1993\\nwas $142.0 million, as compared to $123.5 million at October 31, 1992.  The\\nvalue of the Company\\'s designations, which are awarded projects for which\\ncontracts have not been signed, was $213.6 million at October 31, 1993, as\\ncompared to $154.8 million at October 31, 1992.\\n\\nFiscal 1992 Compared with Fiscal 1991\\n- -------------------------------------\\n  Revenues in fiscal 1992 grew to $136.8 million, or 11% over the amount\\nreported in fiscal 1991.  The growth in revenues is primarily attributable to\\nincreases in revenues generated from the Company\\'s three largest contracts;\\nNavy CLEAN; EPA ARCS 9 & 10; and EPA ARCS 6, 7 & 8.  Combined revenues on\\nthese contracts were $41.7 million in fiscal 1992 compared to $25.5 million\\nin fiscal 1991.  The increase in revenues from these contracts is due to an\\nincrease in the number of task orders for hazardous waste clean-up services. \\nRevenues generated from private commercial businesses increased marginally to\\n$18.9 million from $18.5 million in fiscal 1991.\\n\\n  Direct operating expenses, which consist of direct labor and direct\\nexpenses, including subcontractor costs, increased $12.7 million, or 17% over\\nthe amount reported in fiscal 1991.  The increase is due to a greater volume\\nof subcontractor and outside laboratory services related to the Navy CLEAN\\nand EPA ARCS contracts in fiscal 1992.  Conversely, while revenues increased\\nby 11%, IG&A expenses remained relatively constant at $45 million.  Expressed\\nas a percentage of revenues, IG&A expenses decreased from 37% in fiscal 1991\\nto 33% in fiscal 1992.  The Company attributes this decrease to continued\\nemphasis on cost controls.  Net interest expense decreased from $2.3 million\\nin fiscal 1991 to $1.2 million in fiscal 1992 due to significantly lower debt\\nlevels in fiscal 1992 as the result of the secondary common stock offering\\ncompleted by the Company in June 1991.\\n\\n  The Company earned $4.7 million before income taxes in fiscal 1992 compared\\nto $2.5 million in fiscal 1991.  While the Company has available net\\noperating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes, for state\\nincome tax purposes such amounts are not necessarily available to offset\\nincome subject to tax.  Accordingly, the Company\\'s effective tax rate for\\nfiscal 1992 was approximately 10%.\\n\\n                              Page 15 of 90                            \\n\\n  Net income increased 86% to $4.3 million, compared to $2.3 million in\\nfiscal 1991.  The Company earned $.55 per share in fiscal 1992 compared to\\n$.38 per share in fiscal 1991.\\n\\n  The Company\\'s backlog of signed and funded contracts at October 31, 1992\\nwas $123.5 million, as compared to $120.6 million at October 31, 1991.  The\\nvalue of the Company\\'s designations, which are awarded projects for which\\ncontracts have not been signed, was $154.8 million at October 31, 1992, as\\ncompared to $101.4 million at October 31, 1991.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n- ------------\\n  Prior to October 10, 1989, the Company had available net operating loss\\n(\"NOL\") carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes of approximately\\n$51 million.  As a result of a change in ownership as defined by Section 382\\nof the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") that occurred on October 10, 1989, the\\nCompany\\'s NOL carryforwards for financial statement and Federal income tax\\npurposes became limited to approximately $750,000 per year for the succeeding\\nfifteen-year carryforward period, for an aggregate of $11.2 million, plus NOL\\nattributable to recognized built-in gains, limited to $14 million by IRC\\nSection 382, for a total of $25.2 million.  The financial statement tax\\nbenefits arising from these NOL carryforwards will be recognized as a\\nreduction in financial statement tax expense and an addition to paid-in\\ncapital in the years utilized.  At October 31, 1993, the Company had utilized\\n$8.0 million of the total $25.2 million for Federal income tax purposes and\\n$8.1 million for financial statement purposes.\\n\\n                       Liquidity and Capital Resources\\n                       -------------------------------\\n\\n  The Company\\'s liquidity and capital measurements are set forth below:\\n\\n                                              October 31,\\n                                1993             1992             1991\\n                            ------------------------------------------------\\nWorking capital            $27,684,000      $26,836,000      $21,891,000\\nWorking capital ratio        2.5 to 1         2.6 to 1         2.4 to 1\\nAverage days to\\n  convert billed\\n  accounts receivable\\n  to cash                        67               61               68\\nPercentage of debt to\\n  equity                        28.2%            31.2%            35.9%\\n\\n    In October 1992, the Company amended its existing line of credit\\nagreement with Wells Fargo Bank (the \"Bank\").  The amended line of credit,\\nwhich is secured by all the assets of the Company, provides for advances up\\nto $10,000,000 and expires April 29, 1994.  Borrowings on the line of credit\\nbear interest at the Bank\\'s prime rate plus one-half percent payable monthly\\nin arrears.  At October 31, 1993, the Company had $9,829,000 available to it\\nunder the line of credit.  At October 31, 1993, the Company had outstanding\\nletters of credit totalling $171,000 which reduced the amount available to\\nthe Company under the line of credit.\\n\\n\\n\\n                              Page 16 of 90                            \\n\\n    Under the amended Bank line of credit agreement, the Company is required\\nto satisfy certain financial and non-financial covenants.  The Company was in\\ncompliance with all financial and non-financial covenants related to the line\\nof credit agreement at October 31, 1993 and October 31, 1992.\\n\\n    The Company is a professional services organization and as such, is not\\ncapital intensive.  Capital expenditures during fiscal years 1993, 1992 and\\n1991 were $1,952,000, $1,158,000 and $1,004,000, respectively.  The\\nexpenditures were principally for computer aided design and drafting\\nequipment and facilities expansion to accommodate the Company\\'s growth.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n \\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\\n- -----------------------------------------------------\\n  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of URS\\nCorporation and its subsidiaries.  All significant intercompany accounts and\\ntransactions have been eliminated.\\n\\nRevenue Recognition\\n- -------------------\\n  Revenue from contract services is recognized by the percentage-of-\\ncompletion method and includes a proportion of the earnings expected to be\\nrealized on a contract in the ratio that costs incurred bear to estimated\\ntotal costs.  Revenue on cost reimbursable contracts is recorded as related\\ncontract costs are incurred and include estimated earned fees in the\\nproportion that costs incurred to date bear to total estimated costs.  The\\nfees under certain government contracts may be increased or decreased in\\naccordance with cost or performance incentive provisions which measure actual\\nperformance against established targets or other criteria.  Such incentive\\nfee awards or penalties are included in revenue at the time the amounts can\\nbe reasonably determined. Revenue for additional contract compensation\\nrelated to unpriced change orders is recorded when realization is probable. \\nRevenue from claims by the Company for additional contract compensation is\\nrecorded when agreed to by the customer.  If estimated total costs on any\\ncontract indicate a loss, the Company provides currently for the total loss\\nanticipated on the contract.\\n\\n  Costs under contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to government\\naudit upon contract completion.  Therefore, all contract costs, including\\ndirect, indirect, and general and administrative expenses, are potentially\\nsubject to adjustment prior to final reimbursement.  Management believes that\\nadequate provision for such adjustments, if any, has been made in the\\naccompanying consolidated financial statements.  All overhead and general and\\nadministrative expense recovery rates for fiscal 1987 through fiscal 1993 are\\nsubject to review by the U.S. Government.\\n\\nIncome Taxes\\n- ------------\\n  In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 96,\\ndeferred income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future\\nyears of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and\\ntheir financial reporting amounts.  Investment tax credits are treated as a\\nreduction of income tax expense in the year in which the related assets are\\nacquired.\\n\\n\\n                              Page 23 of 90                            \\n\\n  Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income\\nTaxes (\"SFAS 109\") will be effective for the Company in fiscal 1994.  The\\nCompany believes that the implementation of the new standard will not have a\\nmaterial affect on the Company\\'s consolidated financial statements.\\n\\nDepreciation and Amortization\\n- -----------------------------\\n  Depreciation is provided on the straight-line method over the useful\\nservice lives of the assets.  Goodwill is amortized on the straight-line\\nmethod ranging from 10 to 20 years.\\n\\nIncome Per Share\\n- ----------------\\n  Primary earnings per share calculations are based on the weighted average\\nnumber of shares outstanding, warrants and on shares issuable under stock\\noptions that have a dilutive affect (shares used in such calculations were\\n6,742,000 in 1991, 8,221,000 in 1992 and 6,971,000 in 1993).\\n\\n  Fully diluted earnings per share calculations assume the conversion of the\\nCompany\\'s convertible debentures when there is a dilutive effect on income\\nper share and when the ending market price of the Company\\'s common stock\\nexceeds the average price during the year (shares used in such calculations\\nwere 6,282,000 in 1991, 8,221,000 in 1992 and 6,971,000 in 1993).\\n\\nIndustry Segment Information\\n- ----------------------------\\n  The Company\\'s single business segment, consulting, provides engineering and\\narchitectural services to local and state governments, the Federal government\\nand the private sector.  The Company\\'s services are primarily utilized for\\nplanning, design and program and construction management of infrastructure\\nand environmental projects.\\n\\n  The Company\\'s revenues from local, state and Federal government agencies\\nand private businesses for the last three fiscal years are as follows:\\n\\n                                     Years Ended October 31,\\n                          1993                1992              1991\\n                    ---------------     ---------------    ---------------\\n                                        (In thousands)\\n\\nLocal and state                \\n  agencies         $ 80,350    55%     $ 65,314    48%    $ 68,720     56%\\n\\nFederal agencies     48,713    33        52,530    38       35,614     29\\n\\nPrivate business     16,698    12        18,948    14       18,504     15\\n                     ------   ---       -------   ---       ------    ---\\n\\n  Total            $145,761   100%     $136,793   100%    $122,838    100%\\n                    =======   ===       =======   ===      =======    ===\\n\\n                              Page 24 of 90                            \\n\\nReclassifications\\n- -----------------\\n  Reclassifications of certain balances for the years ended October 31, 1992\\nand 1991 have been made to conform to the October 31, 1993 financial\\nstatement presentation and have not affected previously reported net income\\nor shareholders\\' equity.\\n\\nNOTE 2.  QUASI-REORGANIZATION\\n \\n  In conjunction with a restructuring completed in fiscal year 1990, the\\nCompany, with the approval of its Board of Directors, implemented a quasi-\\nreorganization effective February 21, 1990 and revalued certain assets and\\nliabilities to fair value as of that date.\\n\\n  The fair values of the Company\\'s assets and liabilities at the date of the\\nquasi-reorganization were determined by management to approximate their\\ncarrying value and no further adjustment of historical bases was required. \\nNo assets were written-up in conjunction with the revaluation.  As part of\\nthe quasi-reorganization, the deficit in retained earnings of $92,523,000 was\\neliminated against additional paid-in capital.  The balance in retained\\nearnings at October 31, 1993 represents the accumulated net earnings arising\\nsubsequent to the date of the quasi-reorganization.\\n\\nNOTE 3.

As a result of a change in ownership, as defined by Section 382\\nof the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC\") that occurred on October 10, 1989, the\\nCompany\\'s NOL carryforwards for financial statement and Federal income tax\\npurposes became limited to approximately $750,000 per year for the succeeding\\nfifteen-year carryforward period for an aggregate of $11,250,000, plus NOL\\nattributable to recognized built-in gains limited to $14,000,000 by IRC\\nSection 382, for a total of $25,250,000.  The financial statement tax\\nbenefits arising from these NOL carryforwards will be recognized as a\\nreduction in financial statement tax expense and an addition to paid-in\\ncapital in the years utilized.  At October 31, 1993, the Company had utilized\\n$8,000,000 of the total $25,250,000 for Federal income tax purposes and\\n$8,100,000 for financial statement purposes.\\n\\n  Subsequent to October 10, 1989, the date of the change in ownership, the\\nCompany incurred and has available additional NOL carryforwards of\\napproximately $3,000,000 for Federal income tax and financial statement\\npurposes.

Borrowings on the line\\nof credit bear interest at the Bank\\'s prime rate plus one-half percent. At\\nOctober 31, 1993, the Company had $9,829,000 available to it under the line\\nof credit agreement.  At October 31, 1993, the Company had outstanding\\nletters of credit totalling $171,000 which reduced the amount available to\\nthe Company under its Bank line of credit.\\n\\n  Under the Bank line of credit agreement the Company is required to satisfy\\ncertain financial and non-financial covenants.

On the date of the\\ntransaction, the $2,000,000 in January Notes had a net book value of\\n$1,190,000.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\\n\\n  Currently, the Company has $21,000,000 \"per occurrence\" comprehensive\\ngeneral liability insurance coverage with an aggregate limit of $22,000,000. \\nThe Company has also deposited $1,000,000 with an insurer to cover errors and\\nomissions (\"E&O\") and environmental impairment liability (\"EIL\") claims and\\nmaintains with different insurers\\' policies for excess E&O coverage with an\\naggregate limit of $14,000,000.  The first $1,000,000 policy of E&O and EIL\\ncoverage is essentially self-insurance.  Also, the E&O and EIL coverage is on\\na \"claims made\" basis, covering only claims actually made to the insurer\\nduring the one-year policy period currently in effect.  Thus, if the Company\\ndoes not continue to maintain this policy, it will have no coverage under the\\npolicy for claims made after its termination date even if the occurrence was\\nduring the term of coverage.  It is the Company\\'s intent to maintain this\\ntype of coverage, but there can be no assurance that the Company can maintain\\nits existing coverage, that claims will not exceed the amount of insurance\\ncoverage or that there will not be claims relating to prior periods that were\\nsubject only to claims made coverage.\\n\\n  Various legal proceedings are pending against the Company or its\\nsubsidiaries alleging breaches of contract or negligence in connection with\\nthe performance of professional services.  In some actions punitive or treble\\ndamages are sought which substantially exceed the Company\\'s insurance\\ncoverage.  The Company\\'s management does not believe that any of such\\nproceedings will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial\\nposition and operations of the Company.\\n\\nNOTE 8.

Further, declaration of dividends may be\\nprecluded by existing Delaware law.\\n\\n  In fiscal 1991, the Company in a secondary public offering sold 2,875,000\\nshares of Common Stock at $7.50 per share.\\n\\n  The 1987 Restricted Stock Plan provides for grants of up to 16,537 shares\\nof Common Stock to key employees of the Company and its subsidiaries.  An\\nemployee selected to receive shares under the Plan will not be required to\\npay any consideration for the shares.  Shares issued to an employee are\\nsubject to forfeiture in the event that the employment of the employee\\nterminates for any reason other than death.

The 1979\\nOption Plan also provided for the granting of Stock Appreciation Rights and\\nincentive stock options.  The 1979 Option Plan expired in February 1989, and\\nno further options or rights may be granted under the Plan.\\n\\n  On October 20, 1988, the stockholders approved a replacement option program\\npursuant to which non-management members of the Board of Directors granted\\nreplacement stock options to selected employees, exercisable at then current\\nmarket prices.  The selected employees then exchanged their outstanding\\noptions for new options covering two shares for each three shares covered by\\nthe options being replaced.  Options to purchase 16,561 shares were exchanged\\nfor pre-existing options.\\n\\n  On April 27, 1989, the stockholders approved the 1989 Stock Option and\\nRights Plan (the \"1989 Plan\").  The 1989 Plan provides for the grant of\\n50,000 options to purchase shares of Common Stock to directors, officers and\\nkey employees of the Company and its subsidiaries at prices and for periods\\n(not to exceed ten years) as determined by the Board of Directors.  The 1989\\nOption Plan also provides for the granting of Stock Appreciation Rights.  No\\noptions have been granted under this plan.\\n\\n  On March 26, 1991, the stockholders approved the 1991 Stock Incentive Plan\\n(the \"1991 Plan\").

These individuals are referred to\\nin the Plan as \"Designated Participants.\"  Upon selection to participate in\\nthe Plan, each Designated Participant will be assigned a Target Award\\nPercentage.  This Target Award Percentage, multiplied by the Participant\\'s\\nBase Salary earned during the Plan Year, will equal the Participant\\'s Target\\nAward.  This Target Award represents the amount that is expected to be paid\\nto a Designated Participant if certain financial Performance Objectives for\\nURS have been fully met.\\n\\nIn addition, funds will be set aside for discretionary Awards to selected\\nother Employees (referred to in the Plan as \"Nondesignated Participants\"),\\nwho have demonstrated outstanding individual performance during the Plan\\nYear.  It is expected that the amount available to Non-designated\\nParticipants for the 1993 Plan Year will be $25,000, assuming that URS meets\\nits financial objectives.\\n\\nThe sum of all Target Awards for Designated Participants and expected payouts\\nto Non-designated Participants will equal the Target Bonus Pool.  The Actual\\nBonus Pool will vary from the Target Pool upward or downward based on URS\\'\\nactual performance in relationship to its Performance Objectives.\\n\\nActual Awards to Designated Participants and actual funds available for\\ndistribution to Non-designated Participants will vary from target amounts\\nbased on the relationship between the Actual Bonus Pool and the Target Bonus\\nPool.\\n\\nA detailed description of how the Plan works is presented in the following\\nsections of this document.\\n\\n\\nII.2  DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS\\n\\nPlan participation is extended to selected Employees who, in the opinion of\\nthe Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") of URS, have the opportunity to\\nsignificantly impact the annual operating success of the Company.  These\\nEmployees, referred to as \"Designated Participants,\" will be notified in\\nwriting of their selection to participate in the Plan.  This notification\\nletter, for all Participants except the CEO of URS, will be signed by the CEO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    II-1\\n\\n                              Page 53 of 90                            \\n\\nof URS.  The letter of participation for the CEO will be signed by the\\nchairman of the Compensation Committee.\\n\\nIn addition to the Designated Participants, there may be a group of other\\nEmployees who are selected to receive Awards based on their outstanding\\nindividual performance during the Plan Year.  These other Employees, referred\\nto as \"Nondesignated Participants,\" will not be selected until the completion\\nof the Plan Year.  The selection of Non-designated Participants will be\\ndetermined by the CEO of URS, subject to the approval of the Compensation\\nCommittee.\\n\\n\\nII.3  TARGET AWARD PERCENTAGES FOR DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS\\n\\nEach Designated Participant will be assigned a Target Award Percentage.  This\\nTarget Award Percentage, when multiplied by the individual\\'s Base Salary\\nearned during the Plan Year, represents the anticipated payout to a\\nDesignated Participant if URS\\' Performance Objectives are met.\\n\\nEach Designated Participant\\'s Target Award Percentage will be included in the\\nletter of notification mentioned in Section II.2.\\n\\n\\nII.4  TARGET BONUS POOL\\n\\nThe Target Bonus Pool (Target Pool) will equal the sum of all Target Awards\\nfor Designated Participants PLUS an amount set aside for distribution to\\nNon-designated Participants.  For 1993, the Target Bonus Pool equals\\n$442,000.\\n\\n\\nII.5  URS PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES\\n\\nFor 1993, URS\\' Performance Objectives are focused on the need to improve\\nprofitability and generate cash.  The Performance Objectives and weightings\\nfor the 1993 Plan Year are as follows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    II-2\\n\\n                              Page 54 of 90                            \\n\\n            URS CORPORATION PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES AND WEIGHTINGS\\n\\n    Performance Measure      Weighting            Performance Objective\\n    -------------------      ---------            ---------------------\\n    Net Income ($000s)          50%                      $5,600\\n    Return on Total \\n      Capital (ROTC)            50%                        15%\\n\\nFor the purposes of the Plan, ROTC is defined as:\\n\\n                   [(A+B)   ((C+D) 2)]\\n\\n              where:\\n\\n              A =  Net Income\\n              B =  After-Tax Interest\\n              C =  Interest-bearing debt plus equity at the beginning of the\\n                   Plan Year\\n              D =  Interest-bearing debt plus equity at the end of the Plan\\n                   Year\\n\\nNet Income will be calculated AFTER all URS Corporation (corporate) AND URS\\nConsultants (URSC) bonuses are assumed to have been paid.\\n\\nIt is possible that in the course of the Plan Year, unforeseen events could\\nhave a material effect upon URS Corporation\\'s performance relative to the\\nPerformance Measures.  Such events might include, but are not limited to,\\nacquisitions and public offerings.  The effect of such events will be treated\\non a case by case basis.  In general, acquisitions and public offerings will\\nbe treated as follows:\\n\\nAcquisitions\\n- ------------\\nIn the event that the Company completes an acquisition during the Plan Year,\\nthe Performance Objectives will be adjusted for the projected financial\\nimpact of the acquisition for the balance of the Year and potential Awards\\nunder the Plan will be calculated accordingly.\\n\\nEquity Transactions\\n- -------------------\\nIn the event that URS issues or buys back Company stock during the Plan Year,\\nthe financial impact of such a transaction will not be included in\\ncalculating potential Awards under the Plan.\\n\\nII.6  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERFORMANCE AND THE ACTUAL BONUS POOL\\n\\nThe Actual Bonus Pool (Actual Pool) will vary from the Target Pool based on\\nthe relationship between the actual performance of URS and the Performance\\nObjectives.  The Actual Pool will vary in relationship to the Target Pool\\nbased on the following table:\\n\\n\\n                                    II-3\\n\\n                              Page 55 of 90                            \\n\\n                RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URS PERFORMANCE AND THE\\n            ACTUAL BONUS POOL AS A % OF THE TARGET BONUS POOL\\n\\n     Net Income (weighted 50%)               ROTC (weighted 50%)   \\n     --------------------------          --------------------------\\n      Actual          Actual Pool         Actual         Actual Pool\\n    Performance        as a % of        Performance       as a % of\\n      ($000s)         Target Pool           (%)          Target Pool\\n    -----------       -----------       -----------      -----------\\n      $11,200           200%            30%            200%\\n        5,600           100%                15%            100%\\n     =< 4,200             0%             =< 12%              0%\\n\\n\\n[FN]\\nThe calculation of the Actual Award as a % of Target will be interpolated\\n    for performance between discrete points.\\n\\nAwards have no upper limit and will be extrapolated for performance\\n    beyond discrete points.\\n\\n\\n\\nBased on the table above, the Actual Award will vary depending upon actual\\nperformance in relation to Performance Objectives and the weighting of the\\nPerformance Objectives.  The example on the opposite page illustrates the\\napplication of the table and the interpolation and weighting calculations.\\n\\n\\nII.7  ACTUAL AWARDS TO DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS\\n\\nActual Awards to Designated Participants will vary from Target levels based\\non the relationship between the Actual Bonus Pool and the Target Pool.\\n\\nAfter allocating Actual Awards to Designated Participants, the remaining\\nfunds in the Actual Pool will be available for allocation to Non-designated\\nParticipants.\\n\\nActual Awards distributed to Non-designated Participants will be determined\\non a discretionary basis by the CEO, subject to the approval of the\\nCompensation Committee.  The Company is under no obligation to distribute the\\nentire Actual Pool.  The sum of all Awards to Non-designated Participants may\\nnot exceed the amount available in the Actual Pool.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                    II-4\\n\\n                              Page 56 of 90                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                         III.

Any Actual Award earned\\nin excess of the Target Award will be automatically deferred until the end of\\nfiscal 1994.  This deferred portion of the Award will be paid to the\\nParticipant within 30 days of the end of fiscal 1994, provided that the\\nParticipant is still an Employee of URS or one of its Affiliates at Year-end\\n1994 except for death, permanent disability, or retirement.  A Participant\\nwhose employment with the Company or an Affiliate is terminated prior to the\\nend of fiscal 1994 for any other reason forfeits the deferred portion of the\\nAward.\\n\\nThe Company is under no obligation to pay interest on the deferred portion of\\nthe Award and will not do so.\\n\\n\\nIII.2  EMPLOYMENT\\n\\nIn order to receive an Award under the Plan, a Participant must be employed\\nby URS or an Affiliate at the end of the Plan Year, except as otherwise noted\\nbelow.

The Compensation Committee\\nwill assess the performance of the CEO.\\n\\n\\nIII.3  TERMINATION\\n\\nIf Termination of a Designated Participant\\'s employment occurs during the\\nPlan Year by reason of death, permanent disability, or retirement, the\\nDesignated Participant (or the Participant\\'s heirs in the case of death) will\\nbe eligible to receive a prorata Award based on the time employed as a\\nParticipant and the Objectives achieved for the Plan Year.  Participants who\\nhave earned an Award on this basis will receive payment on the same schedule\\nas other Plan Participants, except that there will be no deferral of Awards\\nin excess of Target.  In the event that a Participant terminates for reasons\\nabove during Fiscal Year 1993, any deferred Award will be paid within 30 days\\nof Termination.\\n\\nA Participant whose employment with the Company or its Affiliates is\\nterminated prior to the end of the Plan Year for any other reason (whether\\nvoluntarily or involuntarily) will forfeit the opportunity to earn an Award\\nunder the Plan.\\n\\n                                    III-1\\n\\n                              Page 58 of 90                            \\n\\nIII.4  OTHER PRO-RATA AWARDS\\n\\nIndividuals who have been selected during the Year for Plan participation and\\nwho have a minimum of three months as a Designated Participant will be\\neligible to receive a pro-rata Award based on the time employed as a\\nParticipant and the Objectives achieved for the Plan Year, provided that the\\nParticipant is employed by URS or an Affiliate at Year-end.\\n\\n\\nIII.5  PLAN FUNDING\\n\\nEstimated payouts for the Plan will be accrued monthly and charged as an\\nexpense against the income statement of URS.  At the end of each fiscal\\nquarter, the estimated Actual Awards under the Plan will be evaluated based\\non actual performance to date.  The monthly accrual rate will then be\\nadjusted so that the cost of the Plan is fully accrued at Year-end.\\n\\nAccrual of Awards will not imply vesting of any individual Awards to\\nParticipants.\\n\\n\\nIII.6  PLAN ADMINISTRATION\\n\\nResponsibility for decisions and/or recommendations regarding Plan\\nadministration are divided among the URS CEO and the Compensation Committee\\nof the URS Board of Directors.  The exhibit on the facing page outlines the\\nlevels of responsibility and authority assigned to each.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the above, the Committee retains final authority regarding\\nall aspects of Plan administration, and the resolution of any disputes.

(\"the Company\") to receive cash Awards based on a\\ncombination of Company and individual performance.\\n\\nAn overview of how the Plan works is shown schematically on the facing page. \\nIn general, a Target Bonus Pool is established.  This amount represents the\\ntotal Awards that are expected to be paid to selected URS Consultants Employees\\nif certain financial Performance Objectives for URS Consultants have been fully\\nmet.  The Actual Bonus Pool will vary from the Target Bonus Pool upward or\\ndownward based on URS Consultants\\' actual performance in relationship to its\\nPerformance Objectives.  This adjusted bonus pool is the Actual Bonus Pool,\\nfrom which Actual Award payouts will be made.\\n\\nAt the beginning of or during the Plan Year, certain Employees will be selected\\nto participate in the Plan.  These individuals are referred to in the Plan as\\n\"Designated Participants.\"  Upon selection to participate in the Plan, each\\nDesignated Participant will be assigned a Target Award Percentage.  This Target\\nAward Percentage, multiplied by the Participant\\'s Base Salary earned during the\\nPlan Year, will equal the Participant\\'s Target Award.  This Target Award will\\nbe earned for meeting both pre-determined URS Consultants and individual\\nPerformance Objectives.  Individual Performance Objectives will vary based on\\nthe Participant\\'s role within the organization.  Each Designated Participant\\'s\\nActual Award could vary from the Target Award, based on the individual\\'s actual\\nperformance measured against his/her Performance Objectives, subject to the\\namount available for distribution from the Actual Bonus Pool.\\n\\nAnother key feature of the Plan is that a portion of the Actual Bonus Pool will\\nbe set aside for discretionary Awards to selected other Employees (referred to\\nin the Plan as \"NonDesignated Participants\"), who have demonstrated outstanding\\nindividual performance during the Plan Year.\\n\\nA detailed description of how the Plan works is presented in the following\\nsections of this document.\\n\\n\\nII.2  DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS\\n\\nPlan participation is extended to selected Employees who, in the opinion of the\\nPresident of URS Consultants and the Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") of URS\\nCorporation (the \"Parent Company\"), have the opportunity to significantly\\nimpact the annual operating success of URS Consultants.  These Employees,\\nreferred to as \"Designated Participants,\" will be notified in writing of their\\nselection to participate in the Plan.  This notification letter will be signed\\nby both the President of URS Consultants and the CEO of the Parent Company.\\n\\n                                     II-1\\n\\n                              Page 71 of 90                            \\n\\nIn addition to the Designated Participants, there may be a group of other\\nEmployees who are selected to receive Awards based on their outstanding\\nindividual performance during the Plan Year.  These other Employees, referred\\nto as \"Nondesignated Participants,\" will not be selected until the completion\\nof the Plan Year.  The selection of Non-designated Participants will be\\ndetermined by the President of URS Consultants, subject to the approval of the\\nCEO of the Parent Company.\\n\\n\\nII.3  TARGET BONUS POOL\\n\\nA Target Bonus Pool is established, representing an amount which is expected to\\nbe sufficient to pay each Designated Participant 100% of his/her Target Award,\\nwith a remaining amount available for distribution to Non-designated\\nParticipants. (The Awards to Non-designated Participants are estimated at\\napproximately 25% of the total Non-Designated Participants\\' Bonus Pool.)\\n\\nThis Target Bonus Pool is determined based on the current group of Designated\\nParticipants and the anticipated group of Nondesignated Participants.  The\\nTarget Pool is subject to change if the group of Designated Participants, the\\ngroup of NonDesignated Participants, or the Base Salaries of Designated\\nParticipants change.\\n\\nSubject to these potential changes, the Target Bonus Pool for the 1993 Plan\\nYear is established at $1,380,244.\\n\\n\\nII.4  URS CONSULTANTS PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES\\n\\nURS Consultants Performance Objectives are focused on the need to achieve\\nstrong operating results (i.e., contribution) and generate cash through the\\nmanagement of DSOs throughout the Year.  Performance will be evaluated based on\\na combination of URS Consultants Contribution, Average Receivables Days Sales\\nOutstanding (DSO), New Sales and Other Growth measures.\\n\\nThe URS Consultants Performance objectives for the 1993 Plan Year are as\\nfollows:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     II-2\\n\\n                              Page 72 of 90                            \\n\\n                    URS CONSULTANTS PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES\\n\\n    Performance Measures          Performance Objectives\\n    --------------------          ----------------------\\n    Contribution ($000s)                 $12,600\\n    Average DSO (Days)                      92\\n    New Sales ($000s)                    $161,000\\n    Other Growth ($000s)          Varies by Participant\\n\\nURS Consultants Contribution is defined as total 1993 Fiscal Year URS\\nConsultants revenues less:\\n\\n    -    Direct cost of sales;\\n    -    Indirect expenses; and\\n    -    ACCRUAL OF EXPECTED AWARDS FOR BOTH DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED\\n         PARTICIPANTS UNDER THE PLAN (I.E., THE PLAN MUST PAY FOR ITSELF)\\n\\nThe subtraction of expected Awards from revenues in calculating contribution\\nunder the Plan means that the Contribution Objective, for purposes of the Plan,\\nis calculated after all bonuses have been accrued, or assumed to have been\\npaid.\\n\\nURS Consultants Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) is defined by the following\\nformula:\\n\\n         BAR + UAR - BEC\\n         ---------------   x 90\\n             REVENUES\\n\\nwhere BAR is billed accounts receivable, UAR is unbilled accounts receivable,\\nBEC is billings in excess of cost, and REVENUES is the sum of the last three\\nmonths revenues.  DSOs will be calculated monthly, and the average of the\\ntwelve months DSOs will equal Average DSOs.\\n\\nURS Consultants New Sales is defined as gross additions to backlog.\\n\\nURS Consultants Other Growth is defined as growth in New Sales, designations,\\nindefinite delivery contracts, inter-office cooperation, and/or other measures\\nas defined in the Participant\\'s notification letter.\\n\\n\\nII.5  WEIGHTING OF URS CONSULTANTS PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES\\n\\nThe Target Bonus Pool will be weighted based on the aggregate weightings of the\\nindividual Participants\\' Performance Objectives in the Plan.  Contribution will\\nbe the most heavily weighted component followed by DSO performance, New Sales,\\nand Other Growth Measures.  An example of the weighting calculation is shown on\\nthe facing page.\\n\\n                                     II-3\\n\\n                              Page 73 of 90                            \\n\\nII.6  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERFORMANCE AND THE ACTUAL BONUS POOL\\n\\nThe Actual Bonus Pool will vary from the Target Bonus Pool based on the\\nrelationship between the actual performance of URs Consultants and the\\nPerformance Objectives.  The Actual Bonus Pool will vary in relationship to the\\nTarget Bonus Pool based on the following table:\\n\\n             RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN URS CONSULTANTS PERFORMANCE AND\\n           THE ACTUAL BONUS POOL AS A % OF THE TARGET BONUS POOL\\n\\n      URS Consultants Contribution              URS Consultants DSO\\n      ----------------------------              -------------------\\n   Actual\\n Performance                     Actual\\n  As A % Of                     Bonus Pool                  Bonus Pool\\n Performance      Actual        As A % Of       Actual       As A % Of\\n  Objective     Performance    Target Pool    Performance   Target Pool\\n -----------    -----------    -----------    -----------   -----------\\n     (%)          ($000s)          (%)           (Days)         (%)\\n\\n  => 115%       => $14,490        200%        =< 87        200%\\n     100%          $12,600        100%               92        100%\\n      85%          $10,710         25%               97         25%\\n   <  85%        < $10,710          0%             > 97          0%\\n\\n            URS Consultants\\n               New Sales               \\n- ---------------------------------------\\n   Actual\\n Performance                      Actual\\n  As A % Of                     Pool Bonus\\n Performance       Actual        As A % Of\\n  Objective     Performance     Target Pool\\n -----------    -----------     -----------\\n    (%)           ($000s)           (%)\\n\\n  => 115%      => $185,150          200%\\n     100%         $161,000          100%\\n      85%         $136,850           25%\\n    < 85%       < $136,850            0%\\n\\n[FN]\\nAwards for the Other Growth performance measure will be made at the\\n    discretion of the President of the Company and the Chief Executive Officer\\n    of the Parent Company.\\n\\nMaximum upside opportunity of 200% of the Target Bonus Pool may be raised\\n    at the discretion of the Compensation Committee.  The calculation of the\\n    Actual Bonus Pool As A % Of Target will be interpolated for performance\\n    between discrete points shown in the table above.\\n\\nBased on the table above, the Actual Bonus Pool could vary between 0% and 200%\\nof the Target Bonus Pool, depending upon actual performance in relation to\\n\\n                                    II-4\\n                              Page 74 of 90                            \\n\\nPerformance Objectives and the weighting of the Performance Objectives.

The formation of the Discretionary Pool will not guarantee any\\nAward payments.  Rather, the Discretionary Pool will be used to recognize\\nselected outstanding Employees in the event that URS Consultants does not meet\\nor exceed 85% of its Contribution Performance Objective.  The total sum of\\nAwards made from the Discretionary Pool may not exceed 25% of the Target Bonus\\nPool.\\n\\n\\nII.8  ACTUAL BONUS POOL ALLOCATION\\n\\nAwards will be paid from the funds available in the Actual Bonus Pool.  The\\nportion of the pool actually allocated to NonDesignated Participants will be\\ndetermined after the end of the Plan Year at the discretion of the CEO of the\\nParent Company, subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee, and may\\nvary from the estimated 20% of the total Actual Bonus Pool.  The sum of the\\nActual Awards paid, including Awards made to Non-designated Participants, may\\nnot exceed the available Actual Bonus Pool.\\n\\n\\nII.9  TARGET AWARD PERCENTAGES\\n\\nEach Designated Participant will be assigned a Target Award Percentage.  This\\nTarget Award Percentage, when multiplied by the individual\\'s Base Salary earned\\nduring the Plan Year, represents the anticipated payout to a Designated\\nParticipant if all URS Consultants and the individual\\'s Performance Objectives\\nare met.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     II-5\\n\\n                              Page 75 of 90                            \\n\\nEach Designated Participant\\'s Target Award Percentage and individual\\nPerformance Objectives will be included in the letter of notification mentioned\\nin Section II.2.\\n\\n\\nII.10  ACTUAL AWARDS FOR DESIGNATED PARTICIPANTS\\n\\nIndividual Performance Objectives will be assigned based on the economic unit\\n(i.e., URS Consultants, a region of URS Consultants, or an office of URS\\nConsultants) on which the Participant\\'s performance has the greatest financial\\nimpact.  Each Designated Participant will be notified of his/her economic unit,\\nthe individual Performance Objectives associated with that unit, the weighting\\nof those Performance Objectives, and the relationship between individual unit\\nperformance and Award levels in the letter of notification mentioned in\\nSection II.2.\\n\\n\\nII.11  ADJUSTMENT TO ACTUAL AWARDS\\n\\nIt is possible that the sum of the Actual Awards for Designated Participants\\ncould exceed the Actual Bonus Pool available for Designated Participants.  This\\nresult could happen for either one of two reasons.  First, the CEO of URS\\nCorporation could allocate more for Awards to Non-designated Participants than\\nwas accrued.  Second, larger economic units could perform worse relative to the\\nsmaller economic units, creating an insufficient Actual Bonus Pool.  In these\\ncases, all Actual Awards will be reduced pro-rata by a factor determined by\\ndividing the Actual Bonus Pool for Designated Participants by the sum of the\\nindividual Actual Awards for Designated Participants.  An example of this\\ncalculation is shown on the opposite page.\\n\\nIf the sum of Actual Awards is less than the Actual Bonus  Pool available for\\nDesignated Participants, there will be no upward pro-ration of Awards paid.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     II-6\\n\\n                              Page 76 of 90                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                          III.

Any Actual Award earned in\\nexcess of the Target Award will be automatically deferred until the end of\\nfiscal 1994.  This deferred portion of the Award will be paid to the\\nParticipant within 30 days of the end of fiscal 1994, provided that the\\nParticipant is still an Employee of URS Consultants or one of its Affiliates at\\nYear-end 1994, except for death, permanent disability, or retirement.  A\\nParticipant whose employment with the Company or an Affiliate is terminated\\nprior to the end of fiscal 1994 for any other reason forfeits the deferred\\nportion of the Award.\\n\\nThe Company is under no obligation to pay interest on the deferred portion of\\nthe Award and will not do so.\\n\\n\\nIII.2  EMPLOYMENT\\n\\nIn order to receive an Award under the Plan, a Participant must be employed by\\nURS Consultants or an Affiliate at the end of the Plan Year, except as\\notherwise noted below.  A Participant must also have performed his/her duties\\nsatisfactorily during the Year, as determined by the URS Consultants President. \\nThe Parent Company CEO will assess the performance of the President and\\nExecutive Vice President.\\n\\n\\nIII.3  TERMINATION\\n\\nIf Termination of a Designated Participant\\'s employment occurs during the Plan\\nYear by reason of death, permanent disability, or retirement, the Designated\\nParticipant (or the Participant\\'s heirs in the case of death) will be eligible\\nto receive a prorata Award based on the time employed as a Participant and the\\nObjectives achieved for the Plan Year.  Participants who have earned an Award\\non this basis will receive payment on the same schedule as other Plan\\nParticipants, except that there will be no deferral of Awards in excess of\\nTarget.  In the event that a Participant terminates for reasons above during\\nFiscal Year 1993, any deferred Award will be paid within 30 days of\\nTermination.\\n\\nA Participant whose employment with the Company or its Affiliates is terminated\\nprior to the end of the Plan Year for any other reason (whether voluntarily or\\ninvoluntarily) will forfeit the opportunity to earn an Award under the Plan.\\n\\n                                     III-1\\n\\n                              Page 78 of 90                            \\nIII.4  OTHER PRO-RATA AWARDS\\n\\nIndividuals who have been selected during the Year for Plan participation and\\nwho have a minimum of three months as a Designated Participant will be eligible\\nto receive a pro-rata Award based on the time employed as a Participant and the\\nObjectives achieved for the Plan Year, provided that the Participant is\\nemployed by URS Consultants or an Affiliate at Year-end.\\n\\n\\nIII.5  PLAN FUNDING\\n\\nEstimated payouts for the Plan will be accrued monthly and charged as an\\nexpense against the income statement of URS Consultants and its economic units. \\nAt the end of each fiscal quarter, the estimated Actual Bonus Pool under the\\nPlan will be evaluated based on actual performance to date.  The monthly\\naccrual rate will then be adjusted so that the cost of the Plan is fully\\naccrued at Year-end.\\n\\nAccrual of Awards will not imply vesting of any individual Awards to\\nParticipants.\\n\\n\\nIII.6  PLAN ADMINISTRATION\\n\\nResponsibility for decisions and/or recommendations regarding Plan\\nadministration are divided among the URS Consultants President, the URS\\nCorporation CEO, and the Compensation Committee of the URS Corporation Board of\\nDirectors.  The exhibit on the facing page outlines the levels of\\nresponsibility and authority assigned to each.\\n\\nNotwithstanding the above, the Committee retains final authority regarding all\\naspects of Plan administration, and the resolution of any disputes.  The\\nCommittee may, without notice, amend, suspend or revoke the Plan.\\n\\n\\nIII.7  ASSIGNMENT OF EMPLOYEE RIGHTS\\n\\nNo employee has a claim or right to be a Participant in the Plan, to continue\\nas a Participant, or to be granted an Award under the Plan.  URS Consultants is\\nnot obligated to give uniform treatment (e.g., Target Award Percentages,\\ndiscretionary Awards, etc.) to Employees or Participants under the Plan. \\nParticipation in the Plan does not give an Employee the right to be retained in\\nthe employment of URS Consultants, nor does it imply or confer any other\\nemployment rights.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                     III-2\\n\\n                              Page 79 of 90                            \\nNothing contained in the Plan will be construed to create a contract of\\nemployment with any Participant.
